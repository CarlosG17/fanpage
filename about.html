                <p>A meme that arose from the Spider Man 2 movie, Tobey Maguire plays Spiderman, and shows up late for his delivery. The phrase he utters is none other than "Pizza Time" and it has become a favorite for many YTP's and a personal favorite meme for me. According to Urban Dictionary "Pizza Time (food)
1. When Peter Parker delivers a pizza "late" and a girl chewing gum viciously isn't paying for those. 
2. Every second of every day."
"It's pizza time." </p>

                <p>In addition to just being pizza time, this phrase has it's own theme song that was created in the Spiderman 2 PS2 game, this song has become just as famous as pizza time itself for it's over the top sound and droning sound design. Know Your Meme explains that "On June 28th, 2004, in preparation for the theatrical release of the Spider-Man 2 film, the video game tie-in for the film was released. The game involved Peter Parker, as Spider-Man, traversing through New York City stopping crime, helping citizens in peril, taking pictures for the newspaper "The Daily Bugle" and performing miscellaneous tasks. One of the side missions finds Parker delivering pizzas for his boss, Mr. Aziz. Parker must deliver the pizzas to potential customers, while trying to keep the pizzas intact as Spider-Man. During the missions, an arrangement of Neapolitan song "Funiculì, Funiculà," composed by Luigi Denza in 1880, plays as Spider-Man delivers the pizzas to his customers." </p>
